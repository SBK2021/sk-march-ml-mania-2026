# Project Title

# Competition Overview

The Brier Score is a measure for quantifying the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. It is defined as the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes, helping teams gauge the performance of their models in competitions like those on Kaggle.

# 4-Week Learning Plan
1. **Week 1:** Introduction to Machine Learning
2. **Week 2:** Data Preprocessing and Exploration
3. **Week 3:** Model Development and Evaluation
4. **Week 4:** Finalizing Models and Preparing Submissions
