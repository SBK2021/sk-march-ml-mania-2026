# Project Overview

## Project Goals
The objective of this project is to participate effectively in the machine learning competition, utilizing advanced techniques to develop a robust predictive model.

## Competition Overview
This competition involves applying machine learning algorithms to forecast outcomes based on a provided dataset. Participants will be evaluated on the accuracy and effectiveness of their models.

## Brier Score Metric
The Brier Score is a metric for assessing the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. It is calculated as the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes, making it a critical evaluation measure for our model's performance.

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms.
2. Gain expertise in data preprocessing and feature engineering.
3. Develop skills in validating and fine-tuning models.
4. Learn how to effectively evaluate model performance using metrics such as Brier Score.
